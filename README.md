Authors: Antonio, [Tiana](https://github.com/tiananc), [Jeff](https://jeffreyfisher.net)

A digital instrument you play with your computer's keyboard. Created for our final project for [Google CSSI](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute).

## Installing / Running
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jegfish/keyano
```

Then, open `bundled.html` in your browser.

Or, you can start an HTTP server:

```sh
$ cd cssi-music-jam/src/public
# serve public folder over HTTP. Can use alternative HTTP server
$ python3 -m http.server
# point your browser to the appropriate port on localhost, e.g., http://localhost:8000
```
